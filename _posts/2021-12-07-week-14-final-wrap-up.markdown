Time used 12 hours (5+2+1+4)<br>
<br>
Last week, I spent 5 hours implementing simple enemy movement and destruction. It should have taken me less time, but I messed up with instantiating clone objects with prefabs. Now, there are flying enemies, and still enemies which have more health since they are easy to shoot. After you destroy all enemies, you win the game. And then I spent 2 hours searching and adding audios to make the game more immersive, including background music, engine of flying enemy, fireball casting, fireball flying, fireball hit, hadouken casting (energy wave), hadouken shoot, hadouken hit, and the explosion when enemy is destroyed. Then, I spent 1 hour building the game and resolving package issues that caused build errors.<br>

I spent the rest of the time creating presentation slides and the itch.io page. Before the showcase, I still need to capture some more interesting in-game images and add them to my itch.io page and slides.<br>
