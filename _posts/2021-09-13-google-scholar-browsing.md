1. <i>The same video game in 2D, 3D or virtual reality – How does technology impact game evaluation and brand placements?</i> <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200724> Analyze how different versions of an identical video game (2D, stereoscopic 3D or Head-Mounted-Display VR) affect users' experience and brands that are placed in the game. Results: The sense of presence is higher in VR condition than in 3D than in 2D; there are no significance differences among the three conditions on players' arousal while playing the game, attitudes towards the game, and attitudes towards the brands placed in the game; memory for placed brands is lower in VR than in 3D than in 2D condition.<br><br>
2. <i>Research and development of virtual reality game based on unreal engine 4</i> <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8248503> Develope a virtual reality game named “MusicMan” with Unreal engine 4 and the HTC Vive. The project is a leisure puzzle game in which players use controllers to hit a rhythm ball that appears at some specific time. The authors mention the biggest advantage of their gameplay: it synchronizes players' behaviors and space movement in the virtual and real world, radically reducing vertigo. Besides the interaction design, the effect of 3D sound and the optimization process helps produce a strong sense of immersion without any sense of vertigo. <br><i>
“The process optimization is reflected in the cut of the consumption of computing memories, avoiding unnecessary operating time. The rendering optimization refers to improving the efficiency of rendering graphics to improve frame rate and reduce the burden of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which can produce a stronger sense of reality with less sense of vertigo. To achieve this, this project uses the method of reducing the complexity of the shader, reducing the complexity of dynamic and static light sources, and decreasing the particle's level of detail (LOD).”</i>
