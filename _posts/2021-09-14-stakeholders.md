*Audience<br>
My primary audience should be people who love video games, no matter of their ages, or they consider spending their spare time playing games. Someone wants to experience something new and fun other than traditional video games.<br>

*Challenges<br>
In order to play VR games, they have to own a headset, or they could go to a VR arcade to experience for a while. VR headsets are expensive, even though some are about the same as game consoles, like playstation or xbox, there are far less good games. There might be no VR arcade near you, or you still need to pay for the tickets, charged by hours.<br>

*Value most<br>
Like traditional games, customers value most whether the game is interesting or not, if it is easy to start with, whether it could be played for a relatively long period of time. They want to experience something different and better than traditional video games.
<br>

*Resoures they got<br>
Some games they bought might have VR version, so they don't need to buy the games again. VR headset is more like a special controller, so they will need their PCs. Also, if they play VR games at home, they need to have enough room.<br>
